            <p class="overview">Hi! I'm Damien Solomon, I've had a small sample size of coding over 20 years ago when I attended Wayne County Community College. I've alwasy knew that I would find my way back to coding. Just recently in the fall of 2021 I got serious and decided to take a Coding workshop as well as apply to Grand Circus for the JavaScript Full Stack boot cam. Although I was unable to attend the course at that particular time I'm now back to finish what I've started.
        <h2 id="my-start">How I got my start</h2>
        <p>I've known about coding for years, but the opportunity for me to jump into it never presented itself up until recently. Once I had an opportunity and took a coding workshop, I knew it was time to continue to pick up where I had left off 20 years ago.</p>
        <p>I chose grand Circus because the coding workshop that I attended, the instructors instructions were clear and precise, also they were Alumni of Grand Circus and they made me feel like I wanted to be apart of the same Alumni.</p>
